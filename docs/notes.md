# Notes

## Buy Strategies

- **Gain-Based**
    1. Identity biggest gainers.
    1. Isolate symbols with "strong buy" outlook.
    1. Purchase.
- **Brute Force**
    1. Compile every symbol available for purchase.
    1. Isolate symbols with "strong buy" outlook.
    1. Purchase.

## Sell Strategies

- **Threshold-Based** - Sell as soon as a certain return threshold is reached. Could be a percentage or dollar amount.
    - PROS:
        - Never sell for a loss.
        - All symbols will sell for a profit, assuming that all symbols eventually rise in value.
    - CONS:
        - High-gainer symbols may be sold long before their peak value.
        - Symbols that immediately decline after purchase may never meet sell criteria (unlikely?).
- **Outlook-Based**  - Sell when the outlook declines. Could sell when downgraded to anything below "buy" or "strong buy".
    - PROS:
        - Theoretically optimizing returns by buying and selling at optimal times
    - CONS:
        - Outlook downgrade could lag behind actual market losses, resulting in smaller gains or possibly losses.
        - "Everstocks" may rarely/never see an outlook downgrade.
- **Time-Based**  - Sell after holding a symbol for a certain length of time.
    - PROS:
        - No symbol will ever go unsold.
    - CONS:
        - Symbols that decline early could be sold for a loss.
- **Hybrid** - Selling requires meeting multiple criteria:
    - A certain gain threshold needs to be met **-and-** the outlook needs to be below "strong buy"
    
        -or-
    - A symbol drops below "hold" outlook.

        -or-
    - A symbol will reach its maximum lifetime for ownership.

## Double Dip Strategies

- **One-and-Done**  - Never purchase a symbol if it is currently held.
- **Double Dip**  - Purchase a symbol again if the outlook is exceptionally strong. Perhaps also stagger purchases by a length of time.
- **Limitless**  - Purchase a symbol again for as long as its outlook is "buy" or better.
